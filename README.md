This repository is the coursework of model AIN when I studied at King's College London from 2019 to 2020
In the pacman file, there is a .py file called MDPAgents.py contains the whole Markov Decision Process program, 
all the other files are not my work. They are provided by my tutor, and they were developed at UC Berkeley.

(a) you can test the code in smallGrid by running:

python pacman.py -q -n 10 -p MDPAgent -l smallGrid

-l is shorthand for -layout. -p is shorthand for -pacman. -q runs the game without the interface (making it faster).

(b) in mediumClassic by running:

python pacman.py -q -n 10 -p MDPAgent -l mediumClassic

The -n 10 runs ten games in a row.
